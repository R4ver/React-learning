## Installation of Projects
First you'll need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed.

When ruby is installed, open a terminal (Command prompt) and type ```gem install sass```

After that, install grunt-cli globally by opening a terminal (Command prompt) and type ```npm install -g grunt-cli```, and then continue.


To get all the necessary files to build the project and compile it:

1. Open a terminal (Command prompt)
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Then type: ```npm install```
4. Wait for npm to install the packages
5. Then type: ```grunt``` and the files will be compiled
6. Opitonal you can type ```grunt watch``` and grunt will watch the files while you make changes.
